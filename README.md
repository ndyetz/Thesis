This file is dedicated to my Thesis project within the Applied Social & Health Psychology (ASHP) program at Colorado State UNiversity. 

I, Neil Yetz, am set to propose at the end of the Fall 2020 semester and defend during the Spring of 2020. 

A quick summary of the project:

As part of the William T. Grant funded project Campus Connections (CC) has been collecting data on the Social Network of the adolescents and the mentors within the program for 3 years. This project has the advantage in that it we have collected longitudinal data across the 12-week mentorship program. Social network data was collected before the start of the program, 3 weeks into the program, 6 weeks, 9 weeks and finally at the last week of CC.

A question that comes to mind is the feasibility of using this methodology on an adolescent population. In other words, are adolescents taking this social network data seriously? Is this a method that is appropriate to use in this population. 

My goal is to create a series of data checks in order to test the validity of the data we have collected for the past 3 years. At the end of the project all adolescents will receive a series "trustworthiness scores" in order to see how much we can trust certain aspects of the data. Then, a composite score will be created to allow us to judge how seriously we can take their social network survey data. With these scores, we can take a look at how much of the data is actually considered valid. From there, any researchers that utilize this social network data can make more informed judgements about their utility of this data. 

These "tustworthiness measures" will consist of validity checks of the mentees social networks. For example, is an adolescents outgoing ties match the incoming ties. how is the repricocity score looking? Are adolescents weighted networks compatible with the weight they receive back when creating a similarity index? In the end, these scores will be used by researchers and they will have the choice as to which network data they want, or do not want to choose whe running analyses. 

From the surface level this may sound like a trivial assignment but the work that will be put into it are huge - Working with social network data often times requires a specialized skillset. Even with the correct skillset, social network data is laborious to collect and even harder to analyze. Additionally, in order to proceed forward with a solid understanding of hwo the social network within an adolescent mentorship program works, this is a necessary step. Additionally, I want to create a tool that can be used across other social network data. This will likely be a series of R-functions that can be incorporated to social network edgelists and easily transferred to other studies. Additionally, if time permits, an R-shiny app will be created to visualize all of this data and furthermore, allow researchers the tools to filter out those participants that lack the trust. 

This README will expand as I progress through the thesis project. I hope to have visualizations and links that will help create an understanding of the project.
